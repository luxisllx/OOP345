1) The Reason for Specializing the 'Sum()' Member Function: for the string, we needed a different format because we had to put a comma to seperate the string. The way to add it was not generic therefore we had to specialize the function. 

2) The Reason for Specializing the initial value for a summation: based on the data type, we need to initialize to different values. For a string, we need to initialize to an empty string. For an int, we need to initialize to zero.

3) The Reason for Defining the class variable outside the class definition: when we use internal linkage ('static'), we define the class variable outside the class definition so that it is visible to other scopes within its unit. All instances of the same class share the same variable, thus when we set the variable outside the definition, it will be available to all instances because it has global scope. 

4) What I Learned: I learned how to inherit a template, how to use specialization, and how to use polymorphism by making the base class function virtual and then redefining it in the derived class. 

5) What Was Difficult: I had a difficult time to figure out where to put the specialization. Additionally, the syntax of the inheritance also took quite a bit of time to research and re-read the class notes. How to access the base class member was also something I struggled with in this class. Finally, debugging the 'static' variables consumed some time as well. I solved all of these difficulties by re-reading over notes, looking at examples and snippets online, as well as trial-and-error.
