REFLECTION


Q. the advantage that smart pointer syntax provides. Use example from your code to support your explanation.
A. with a smart pointer, we don't need to delete the object. The advantage of that is it will manage the memory by itself.
An example in my code was: std::shared_ptr<Product> tmp(new Product(desc[i].desc, price[j].price));
This section of the code created a product object but didn't require deletion.

Q. the difference between raw and smart pointer syntax in your solution.
A. the difference for creating in my solution is as following:
	raw: Product* tmp = new Product(desc[i].desc, price[j].price);
   	smart: std::shared_ptr<Product> tmp(new Product(desc[i].desc, price[j].price));
for deletion:
	raw: delete tmp;
	smart: does not require deletion
