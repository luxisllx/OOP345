In OOP345 Lab02, I learned the following: Move constructor and Move assignment operator
In a move constructor, I learned that it takes resources from an expression with NO memory address(rvalue) and move it into an expression with memory address(lvalue) without creating its copy. By using a move constructor to move ownership rather than copying, it is both time efficient and less expensive. A move assignment operator is called when we transfer a temp object into an existing object. 

Sometimes it is more pratical to use a move constructor than a copy constructor because of the speed. Move constructors will tend to be faster than copying because they are transfering an existing resource to a new destination. On the other hand, copy constructors will require the creation of a new resource from the beginning and it allocates memory. 

The difficult part of the lab was the in-lab portion where we were required to use the given syntaxs: std::chrono::steady_clocks....etc.
It was fairly confusing at first because it was something that I had never experienced before. After reading the given documentation and reading some sample codes online, I was able to write the functions.
